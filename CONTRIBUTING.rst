articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/stdtom/ssl_certinfo/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `ssl_certinfo` for local development.
These instructions will assume that you have already poetry (https://python-poetry.org/) locally installed
on your development computer.

1. Fork the `ssl_certinfo` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/ssl_certinfo.git

3. Initialize your local development environment of ssl_certinfo.copy.
   This will include creating a virtualenv using poetry, installing dependencies and registering git hooks
   using pre-commit::

    $ cd ssl_certinfo/
    $ make init-dev

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass linting, formating, and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ make lint         # check style with flake8
    $ make format       # run autoformat with isort and black
    $ make test         # run tests quickly with the default Python
    $ make test-all     # run tests on every Python version with tox


6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, and for PyPy. Check
   https://travis-ci.com/stdtom/ssl_certinfo/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

$ poetry run pytest  tests/test_ssl_certinfo.py


Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
